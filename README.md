Resume Extractor Plan for Aivancity School for Technology

1.	Problem Statement:
   
Aivancity School receives numerous resumes from applicants for program grand Ecole. The manual process of screening these resumes is time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to delays in the selection process.

3.	Proposed Solution:
   
Develop an automated Resume Extractor that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning algorithms to parse and extract relevant information from resumes. The tool will categorize and present the extracted data in a structured format, making it easier and faster to analyze.

5.	Impact:
   
The Resume Extractor will significantly reduce the time and effort required to process resumes. It will enhance the efficiency of the admissions team, allowing them to focus on decision-making rather than data extraction. This tool can also be used to identify the most suitable candidates based on specific criteria, improving the quality of the selection process.
